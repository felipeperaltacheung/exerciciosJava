//// 1 human year = 7 dog years
//
////    It is commonly said that one human year is equivalent to 7 dog years. However this
////        simple conversion fails to recognize that dogs reach adulthood in approximately two
////        years. As a result, some people believe that it is better to count each of the first two
////        human years as 10.5 dog years, and then count each additional human year as 4 dog
////        years.
////
////        Write a program that implements the conversion from human years to dog years
////        described in the previous paragraph. Ensure that your program works correctly for
////        conversions of less than two human years and for conversions of two or more human
////        years. Your program should display an appropriate error message if the user enters
////        a negative number.
